Joan Henshaw, founder of Ladder Consulting and the [10 Minute Management Toolkit](http://www.10mmt.com/), provides consultancy on human performance management. Joan and I worked together on an email newsletter and blogging strategy to promote her consultancy services and raise awareness of Joan's blogging on performance management techniques for managers.


I designed a branded HTML email template and set up a [Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com) account for Joan to manage her email marketing activity. As well as sending newsletters, the account provides Joan with analytics on:

- newsletter open rates and views
- click-throughs from the newsletter to her website
- subscribers joining and leaving the mailing list

> “One of Gavin's key strengths is his ability to help me clarify what I want to achieve from my website, newsletters and email campaigns and then meeting those needs in a creative way. He is very supportive and an excellent source of advice and insight. Highly recommended.” &mdash; Joan Henshaw, Ladder Consulting

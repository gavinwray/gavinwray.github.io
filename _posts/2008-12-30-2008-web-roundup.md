Here are sites and people I've found particularly inspiring, informative or useful this year. This list isn't meant to be definitive or a reflection on trends; it's just a way of sharing sites and highlighting individuals who influenced me.

## Design

These are a mix of web design-focused magazine and tutorial sites alongside a couple of broader design blogs.

### [Blog.SpoonGraphics](http://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/)

This is one big inspiration feed. The creator Chris Spooner, a UK based graphic and web designer, writes great tutorials at on design projects typically focused on Photoshop, Illustrator, CSS and WordPress.

### [Web Designer Wall](http://webdesignerwall.com/)

![Web Designer Wall](/assets/2008/12/web-designer-wall.png)

Covers design ideas and trends as well as providing tutorials on the more technical aspects of web design. The [complete WordPress theme guide](http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/complete-wordpress-theme-guide) is one of the best introductions I've found so far on how to install and customise your own WordPress site.

### [Design solutions](http://www.flickr.com/photos/guspim/collections/72157600047307884/)

Gustavo Pimenta created this collection of screenshots using flickr, organising them into user interface elements, styles and tasks. This collection is handy when you're facing a creative block.

### [DesignM.ag](http://designm.ag/)

A resource for designers (focused on the web side) with tutorials, articles and site galleries.

For all things type.

## Portfolio sites

I'm hooked on portfolio sites. When I worked as an editor for the book publishers [friends of ED](http://www.apress.com), a great part of the job was browsing portfolios to commission new authors to write about web design.

While it's easy to get hung up thinking that [your own portfolio sucks](http://astheria.com/design/my-last-portfolio-sucked-yours-might-too), portfolio sites can often be the most inspiring. Here are four of my favourites:

* [Piotr Kulczycki travel photography](http://www.worldinmylens.com/): As well as the actual photo content and an aesthetically-attractive site, I like the way Piotr uses tags and sets to make his portfolio straightforward to browse.
* [Eleven3](http://www.eleven3.com/): George Huff's portfolio is a nice example of a highly customised WordPress site with some nifty scripting. I love the retro background images, footer design and clever sidebar navigation.
* [Marius Roosendaal](http://www.mariusroosendaal.com/): Beautifully-presented work in a clever one-page site design making use of a simple, intuitive navigation.
* [2Advanced Studios](http://www.2advanced.com/): Personally, I was saturated by too many Flash-based portfolios several years ago. However, for high visual impact, Hollywood standard production, all guns blazing, jaw-dropping Flash magicianry, 2Advanced Studios still surprise me. This is web design as an experience; it's way beyond information communication.

## Twitter and Birmingham Bloggers

After a failed attempt in 2007, combined with some encouragement from a vocal group of Twitter enthusiasts at [WordCampUK](http://uk.wordcamp.org/), I started using Twitter to meet other web types based in Birmingham. It's been a revelation.

Twitter is a micro-blogging tool where individuals post a note up to 140 characters long answering the question ‘what are you doing?’

Starting out on Twitter can feel strange; it didn't make sense for me until I followed a sizeable number of people (following other people means that you see their updates). Finding others to follow can be difficult but fortunately [Stef Lewandowski](https://stef.io/) brought everyone together in 50+ Birmingham Twitter users you need to follow [no longer online].

You can follow me on Twitter [@gavinwray](http://twitter.com/gavinwray).

### Paradise Circus

As a result of Twitter, I discovered a whole new community of people [blogging about or in Birmingham](http://www.paradisecircus.com/): commentators, artists, consultants, technologists, musicians… oh, and a few web designers too!

## Social media and the public sector

In July 2008 I helped to launch [Observations](http://wmro.wordpress.com), a new blog for the [West Midlands Regional Observatory](http://www.wmro.org) where I work as the Web & Data Officer. In tandem with this new project, I've been looking for individuals working in, and examples of, social media in a public sector context.

[Dave Briggs](http://davepress.net/) works as a ‘digital enabler for the public sector’. His blog has been helpful in learning about the world of digital technology in communities, local government and other public sector contexts, specifically <del>public sector bloggers</del> [no longer online] and the [UKGovWeb Twitterverse](http://kindofdigital.com/2008/10/28/the-ukgovweb-twitterverse/).

[Nick Booth](http://podnosh.com/) is a ‘social media doer, teacher and consultant’. As well as attending a couple of Nick's presentations introducing social media, I've been reading his informative blog on how social media is being used and its potential in community contexts in Birmingham.

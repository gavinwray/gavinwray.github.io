[Hillu Liebelt](https://www.hilluliebelt.com) is a textile artist. Her exhibition _Delicate Matters_, first exhibited at the Hishio Centre for Cultural Exchange in Japan, is touring the UK in 2009.

To coincide with the tour, Hillu and I worked together to update her portfolio site (which I designed in July 2007) with images of:

- new cuttings gallery
- eight new tapestries
- two new sculptures and models
- Hillu's _Dance_ sculpture installed at her recent exhibition in Katsuyama, Japan

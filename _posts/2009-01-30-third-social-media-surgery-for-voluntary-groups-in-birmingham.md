Here's a quick writeup following the third [social media surgery](http://socialmediasurgery.com/surgeries/central-birmingham) for voluntary and community groups in Birmingham. The event was organised by [Nick Booth](http://www.podnosh.com/) and held at the [Birmingham Voluntary Services Centre](https://www.bvsc.org/).

At these surgeries, volunteers and community group representatives discover how they can make use of social media. This could be starting a blog to bring people together around a common issue, organising a Facebook group or sharing a video on YouTube to communicate a story.

Volunteer ‘surgeons’ offer advice on freely available social tools in a one-to-one or small group environment. No presentations, lecturing or jargon &ndash; just people with knowledge, ideas and passion to help community groups make the most of the internet.

I met Jon at the surgery. He runs a martial arts academy in Birmingham. Jon advocates how people can use martial arts training to help disadvantaged groups. He wanted advice on:

- setting up a blog as an online home for the academy
- using social tools to connect people around martial arts training and disadvantaged groups

We looked at how to start a free [WordPress blog](http://wordpress.com), tweak the design and personalise the blog. One day later, it's great to see Jon's blog up and running at [Epic Martial Arts](http://epicmartialarts.wordpress.com/). Great stuff! I'm looking forward to seeing how Jon develops his blog as a community hub to bring together people who share interests in the therapeutic and rehabilitating potential of martial arts training.

I also met Chris at the surgery. Chris, Jon and I looked at [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) as a means to make contact with other people interested in similar issues.

Other surgeons were [Nick Booth](http://www.podnosh.com/), [Jon Bounds](http://www.jonbounds.co.uk),[ Simon Whitehouse](http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk), [Danny Smith](http://edgetrinkets.com/), Abby Corfan, [Katie Spragg](http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/), [Pete Ashton](http://ash10.com/), [Philip Oakley](http://philipoakley.org/), [Jon Hickman](http://www.theplan.co.uk/), [Ben Whitehouse](http://benjaminbrum.wordpress.com/) and [Joanna Geary](http://www.joannageary.com/). (Apologies if I've missed anyone.)

This is the second surgery I've been to. They're refreshing, fun and you learn a lot.

I recently photographed a collection of old cameras and scanned the instruction guides. This is to preserve them graphically and to act as a small kind of tribute to a special person who owned these cameras and was passionate about his photography.

I've shared the full set on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gavinwray/sets/72157615317138680/). Here's the slideshow:

James Wood recently set up his own business specialising in recruitment and executive search within management consultancy and professional services. He wanted a CV-style site that clearly explains what he does. I designed a single-page, all-type, site for him at [jameswood.eu](http://jameswood.eu).

I designed the layout, wrote the XHTML and CSS, then attached it all to [CushyCMS](http://www.cushycms.com) so that James can update the site himself.

The idea behind the design is to communicate the information as clearly and simply as possible. Itâ€™s all about giving the reader key information quickly and removing the need to browse using a traditional site navigation.

To do this, I concentrated on careful typography to structure all the content within a single page. I also added jump links at the top of the page for the visitor to skip down to relevant sections within the page.

The [Birmingham social media surgery](http://socialmediasurgery.com/surgeries/central-birmingham) for voluntary and community groups is now one year old. Huzzah! The first surgery took place in October 2008 at the [BVSC](http://www.bvsc.org/) and since then has developed into something special.

Here's a video capturing the essence of what the surgery is and how those taking part feel about it (video by [John Popham](http://johnpopham.wordpress.com/) and questions from organiser [Nick Booth](http://podnosh.com)).

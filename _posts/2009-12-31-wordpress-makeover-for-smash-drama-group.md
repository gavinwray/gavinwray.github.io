[SMASH (Solihull Methodists Acting and Singing in Harmony)](http://www.solihull-smash.org.uk) are a music and drama group based at Solihull Methodist Church.

I've maintained the WordPress site for SMASH since 2006. The site contains a photo archive of past productions and a blog about the group's activities, such as upcoming shows, rehearsal details and ticket booking.

I updated the site last month with a new information architecture, making better use of WordPress's [categories](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category) to organise and surface content through the site.

The site also has a fresh, new look more in keeping with the world of theatre. I used [Justin Tadlock](http://justintadlock.com/)'s Options theme [no longer online], a magazine-style theme well suited to community groups. I then tweaked the theme's CSS, adding a new colour palette, type scheme and background image.

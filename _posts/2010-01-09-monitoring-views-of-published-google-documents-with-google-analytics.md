_Edited 25 April 2012: since I wrote this post, Google have removed the ability to use your analytics ID to track published Google Docs._

Browsing this morning, I discovered that you can track views of your published [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) using your [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/) account.

A published Google Doc is one that you have chosen to openly share with anyone on the web.

To turn on tracking of your published documents:

1. Go to your [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) account.
2. Choose **Settings** and go to the **Editing** tab.
3. Select the checkbox next to **Use Google Analytics to track the number of visits to your published documents**.
4. Paste your Google Analytics tracking code:

Views of all documents published from this account now appear in your reports.

## How to publish a document

1. To publish a Google Doc, go to **Share > Publish as web page**:

2. Choose **Publish document**:

## Limitations

Note that this feature tracks published documents only. At the time of writing, tracking is not available for spreadsheets or presentations.

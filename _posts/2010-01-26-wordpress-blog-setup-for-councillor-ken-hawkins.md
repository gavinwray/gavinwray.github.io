At the end of 2009, Councillor Ken Hawkins and I worked together to set up a [new website](http://cllrkenhawkins.wordpress.com/) that Ken uses to write about issues in [Elmdon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmdon,_West_Midlands) and [Solihull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solihull) in his role at [Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council](http://www.solihull.gov.uk/).

Ken was already using [Google Blogger](http://www.blogger.com). Following sessions at a [social media surgery](http://socialmediasurgery.com), he wanted to do more with his blog's content and presentation.

I helped Ken by setting up his WordPress site, transferring legacy content from the previous blog to WordPress and setting up the new blog's layout.

Ken wanted a clear layout with straightforward navigation. To provide this, I chose the [Grid Focus](http://5thirtyone.com/grid-focus) theme by [Derek Punsalan](http://5thirtyone.com/).

Rather than a traditional menu navigation, all the content sits within a single page and browsed via categories.

We wrapped up with a demonstration session on using the WordPress admin interface to:

- write posts
- upload images
- assign categories
- manage comments

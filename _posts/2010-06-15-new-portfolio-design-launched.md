After two months beavering away, I've launched a new design for this portfolio site. I hand-crafted the HTML/CSS and built the WordPress theme from scratch.

This design is the fifth version of my site. It reflects the [positioning](/2010/04/an-update-on-what-im-doing/) and thinking I've done this year.

The design's core comes from some detailed study of [grid layouts](/2010/06/designing-with-grids/) and trying out a new approach to content strategy. This made for some odd conversations with myself, as both client and designer.

For now, I'm just pleased to launch the site. I hope you like it. As ever, any feedback, suggestions or ideas would be appreciated.

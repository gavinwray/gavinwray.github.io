This is an internal presentation I gave to researchers at the [West Midlands Regional Observatory](https://wmro.wordpress.com) last month.

My aims were to:

- advocate for the open data movement's principles
- translate policy developments during 2009 and 2010 into meaningful and practical steps the researchers could take

I tailored the presentation to those working with datasets every day.

The presentation also covers helping staff contribute to open data initiatives by making small changes to current working habits -- the first three stars of Ed Summers' [five stars of open linked data](http://inkdroid.org/journal/2010/06/04/the-5-stars-of-open-linked-data/).

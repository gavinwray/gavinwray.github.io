Today is my first day in a new secondment at [Podnosh](https://podnosh.com), a consultancy specialising in social media for social and democratic benefit. Podnosh is based in central Birmingham, and is run and owned by Nick Booth.

For the rest of this year, I'll be spending two days a week with Podnosh and three days a week in my current communications role at the [West Midlands Regional Observatory](https://wmro.wordpress.com).

Areas I'll be working on include:

* social media surgeries
* web design and development
* training customers to use their websites
* developing approaches to open data to strengthen the connection between citizens and public information

Exciting times!

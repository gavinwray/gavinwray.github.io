This was a fun project to work on. [Jon Bounds](http://www.jonbounds.co.uk/) built the Christmas-o-meter, which rates Twitter users' Christmas cheer based on their 20 latest tweets. It's based on his [sentiment analysis tool](http://www.jonbounds.co.uk/blog/989/is-birmingham-happy/) and rates words in tweets against a database of words with emotional value. Tweets mentioning Christmas score more.

I provided the visual design, HTML and CSS.

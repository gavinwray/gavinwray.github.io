_[Dirty Bristow](http://dirtybristow.co.uk/)_ is a magazine “dedicated to resurrecting the magazine as a fetish object, giving creative people the room to let their minds go. No ads. No rules.”

Each magazine issue has a theme. The second issue's theme is _Beast_ -- with text, illustrations and web design contributions from people interpreting the theme as they wish.

I made a WordPress theme to skin Dirty Bristow's website for the second issue.

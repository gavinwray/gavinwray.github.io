TweetPysch “creates a psychological profile of any public Twitter account and compares it to the thousands already in the database. This identifies those traits that are used more or less frequently by the user analyzed.”

You get a nice bar chart summarising your traits by how much more, or less than, they differ from the average on Twitter.

You also get more detailed descriptions of each trait, what it means and your score:

TweetPsych returns scores for the following traits or content. The following list is ordered by my reported traits, starting with higher than average and working down to lower than average:

1. Positive sentiment (42%)
2. Learning and education (35%)
3. Past (7%)
4. Primordial (6%)
5. Constructive (3%)
6. Future (-3%)
7. Anxiety (-5%)
8. Control (-5%)
9. Senses (-7%)
10. Social (-7%)
11. Media (-11%)
12. Conceptual (-12%)
13. Time (-18%)
14. Work (-25%)
15. Self Reference (-30%)
16. Present (-30%)
17. Negative (-30%)
18. Money (-33%)
19. Thinking (-36%)
20. Numbers (-37%)

The report is a snapshot in time (today) though I'm unsure how far back TweetPsych analyses my Twitter history.

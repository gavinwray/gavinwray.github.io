Some fun to kick off the new year - an infographic representing yours truly based on my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gavinwray) data. I made it with visual.ly's Twitterize Yourself wizard.

Apparently, I have a geeky grin, tweet more positively than negatively, wear techy t-shirts and am possibly obsessed with football. Uncanny! Even the quiff is correct.

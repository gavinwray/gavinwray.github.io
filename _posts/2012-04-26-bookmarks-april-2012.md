[Debategraph](http://debategraph.org/Stream.aspx?nid=61932&iv=05) - “Debategraph lets us visualize and share networks of thought – making our reasoning transparent and open to collaborative and iterative reflection, questioning and improvement.”

[The Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/) - “This handbook introduces you to the legal, social and technical aspects of open data. It can be used by anyone but is especially useful for those working with government data. It discusses the why, what and how of open data – why to go open, what open is, and the how to do open.”

[Wrangl - Make sense of the arguments for and against](http://wrangl.com/) - a neat debate visualisation tool made by [Stef Lewandowski](http://stef.io/) to clearly show arguments for and against a topic you choose.

[The Digital Engagement Guide](http://www.digitalengagement.info/) - a great set of resources, guides and ideas pulled together by Steph Gray of [Helpful Technology](http://www.helpfultechnology.com/).

[Visualising Advocacy](http://drawingbynumbers.org/) - Tactical Tech's new project on data visualisation tools and processes for activism and advocacy.

[The Periodic Table of Content](http://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/content-chemistry?goback=.gde_3686837_member_105904084) - practical, neat visual explaining different content types, what they are for and the effort required to create them.

[Kaggle and Crowdsourcing Data Modeling](http://www.kaggle.com/about) - “Kaggle is an innovative solution for statistical/analytics outsourcing. We are the leading platform for predictive modeling competitions. Companies, governments and researchers present datasets and problems - the world's best data scientists then compete to produce the best solutions. At the end of a competition, the competition host pays prize money in exchange for the intellectual property behind the winning model.”

[UX Myths](http://uxmyths.com/) - “Build your website based on evidence, not false beliefs! UX Myths collects the most frequent user experience misconceptions and explains why they don't hold true.”

[Nesta Innovation in Giving](http://giving.nesta.org.uk/) - microsite bringing together the stories of the organisations and ideas supported through the Innovation in Giving Fund.

[Timeline JS](http://timeline.verite.co/) - “Beautifully crafted timelines that are easy, and intuitive to use.” You'll need a bit of coding ability, as well as good content selection choices, but this tool can help you present effective stories. I think this could be a nice way to present a CV or an organisation's progress.

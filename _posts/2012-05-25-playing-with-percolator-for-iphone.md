[Percolator](http://www.percolatorapp.com/) for iOS creates mosaic images from your photos. The process is straightforward. Using the app, you take a photo via the built-in camera or choose an existing photo from your photo library. 
  
There are three types of filters to play with:

* Grind turns your photo into a mosaic
* Brew controls different types of shapes, such as circles, stars and rings
* Serve adds finishing touches with colour and texture

Here are my [first experiments](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gavinwray/sets/72157629713798362/with/7234040472/):

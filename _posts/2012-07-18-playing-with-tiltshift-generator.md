I've been playing with the [TiltShift Generator](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tiltshift-generator-fake-miniature/id327716311?mt=8) app by [Art & Mobile](http://artandmobile.com/). The tiltshift effect, making real objects and places look like toy models, relies on changing the focus, blur and saturation. There's an online version, desktop AIR alternative and iPhone app. 

Here are some images I've created so far (there are more on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gavinwray/sets/72157629087518648/with/7426171126/)).

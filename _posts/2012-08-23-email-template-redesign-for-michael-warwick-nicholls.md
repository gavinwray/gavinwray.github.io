Michael Warwick Nicholls, a specialist management consultancy recruitment business, required their email newsletters updating in line with their current brand.

We first worked together in 2007 to set up an email newsletter system using [Campaign Monitor](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/). On this job, I updated the HTML email templates to reflect MWN's new brand and supported two staff to use Campaign Monitor to manage their own email campaigns.

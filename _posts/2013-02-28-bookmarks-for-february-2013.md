[Contrast Rebellion](http://contrastrebellion.com/) – a well-crafted lesson in ensuring type on the web is readable using high contrast. Has some good examples of how designers can let their aesthetic preferences trump readability. This article reminded me I need to tweak the contrast in the new theme I'm using on this site. I'm guilty of having some grey type on creamy background colours and the links in the right-hand sidebar are too lightweight.

[From Content Audit to Design Insight](http://uxmag.com/articles/from-content-audit-to-design-insight) – this article in UX Magazine explains the important leap from raw content audit results in a spreadsheet to informing and evidencing website redesign decisions.

[Bite-sized chunks of info are best](http://www.theteamw.com/2010/05/07/100-things-you-should-know-about-people-33-bite-sized-chunks-of-info-are-best/) – Susan Weinschenk writes about using progressive disclosure to give bite-sized pieces of information in websites:

> "Sometimes you will hear people say that websites should minimize the number of clicks that people have to make to get to the detailed information. The number of clicks is not the important criteria. People are very willing to make multiple clicks, in fact that won’t even notice they are making the clicks, if they are getting the right amount of information at each click to keep them going down the path. Think progressive disclosure, don’t count clicks."

[Teenage Usability: Designing Teen-Targeted Websites](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-of-websites-for-teenagers/) – a study by the Nielsen Norman Group on how teenagers actually use websites, and what their web literacy skills are, which refutes many stereotypes. In summary:

> "Teens are (over)confident in their web abilities, but they perform worse than adults. Lower reading levels, impatience, and undeveloped research skills reduce teens’ task success and require simple, relatable sites."

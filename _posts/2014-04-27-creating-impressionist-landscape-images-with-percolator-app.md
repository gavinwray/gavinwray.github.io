Lyndsey and I adopted Mia, a rescue dog, in February which means we're walking more and exploring local parks. When taking Mia for a walk, we spend a lot of time standing still, waiting for her to satisfy her curiosity with wildlife and plants.

With a warm spring in the UK, my neighbourhood park has looked lovely, full of daffodils, bluebells and crocuses. I've fortunately had the time to absorb it. The scenes and colour reminded me of Impressionist landscapes by Claude Monet and Louis Oscar Griffith.

So, how about making an Impressionist-style landscape image on an iPhone? I used [Percolator](http://percolatorapp.com), a photo mosaic app, to create the following image. It's no masterpiece worthy of Monet but I'm pleased with it!

These are the steps I followed to create the image in Percolator.

1. Find a landscape photo with strong bands of colour. I used a photo of [crocuses in Highbury Park](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gavinwray/13037225135/).

2. Open Percolator, select **Choose photo** and browse to the source image.

3. Open the menu options by selecting the coffee mug icon.

4. Start by selecting **Extra fine** in the left-hand column, **Overprint** in the centre column and **Light & Sweet** in the right-hand column:

5. Expand the options by selecting the arrow to the right of the **Extra fine** label. I used **Average** to set the size of the circles and **Saturate** to enhance the colour of those crocuses and the hedgerow. You may need to select **Re-grind** to apply the new settings.

6. Expand the **Overprint** options. Choose **¾** in the centre column and **Full** in the right-hand column:

7. Expand the **Light & Sweet** options. I used **Rise-n-Shine** in the centre column to add a spring sunshine feel and **Brown Bag** in the right-hand column for the canvas-like texture:

8. When you're happy with your image, select the heart icon to save the image to your photo library or share it online.

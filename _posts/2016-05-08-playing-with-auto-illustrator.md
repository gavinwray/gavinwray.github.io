After buying a shiny new Mac in April, I can now access my old image libraries. I found these experimental images created with Auto-Illustrator, a generative vector art application developed by [Adrian Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Ward_(artist)).

Auto-Illustrator (no longer online at its original home [swai.signwave.co.uk](http://swai.signwave.co.uk/)) has a user interface that mimics popular vector drawing applications. The software adds its own interpretation to the user's drawing input, which makes for a random and playful experience.

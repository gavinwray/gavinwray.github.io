You know those crisp, beautiful autumn mornings with azure skies and a low sun jabbing fingers of light through the trees into a carpet of mist? Lovely.

I took my camera to the park today while walking the dog. Each scene, viewed by eye, was a perfect English autumn composition. My photos? Rubbish! Underexposed, weak sunlight and a flat pastel sky.

I tried to rescue an image with heavy editing using my favourite photo editor, the [Enlight app](https://www.enlightapp.com/). I used blending to combine two photos into this woodland scene:

I'm chuffed with the result. It's peaceful yet surreal.

Next, I merged a photo I took of Crosby beach (site of Sir Antony Gormley's _[Another Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Place_(sculpture))_ with a space image:

To make the following image, I started with a double exposure from two of my own photos, _[Last of the light](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gavinwray/24388347119/)_ and [Formby beach](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gavinwray/14944380243). Next, I placed an aged structure that's unsettling and incongruous in a rural scene.

I've had the idea for this composition mind for a while. It's inspired by Simon Stålenhag's digital painting in <em>[Tales from the Loop](http://frialigan.se/en/store/?product_id=8823427333)</em>. The iron structure is a close-up of [Zeche Zollern mine head tower](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wwwuppertal/11651591514/) ([CC BY-NC 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/)) by Werner Wittersheim.

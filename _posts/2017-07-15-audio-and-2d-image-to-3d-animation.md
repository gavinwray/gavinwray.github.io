I've started learning how to make generative graphics using [TouchDesigner](https://www.derivative.ca). The scope of what people make with the software is incredible and inspiring, while the learning curve is steep.

After reading the [introductory book](https://www.gitbook.com/book/nvoid/introduction-to-touchdesigner)Â to understand the user interface and workflow, I wanted to make a graphic react to a musical source. Building on that, maybe I can use MIDI data as another input.

Here's my first test using a [TOE file by Indae Hwang](http://www.indaehwang.com/touchdesigner/audio_visual_2dimageto3dshape/) and my own [audio track](https://soundcloud.com/finalpilots/summons):

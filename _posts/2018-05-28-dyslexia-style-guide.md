The British Dyslexia Association have updated their [Dyslexia Style Guide](http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/common/ckeditor/filemanager/userfiles/Dyslexia_Style_Guide_2018-final.pdf) for 2018.

The guide helps designers, developers and publishers to consider the difficulties dyslexic readers experience and to improve the readability of written content.

By following the principles in this guide you can improve the reading experience for everyone, not only those with dyslexia.

The style guide has five sections:

* readable fonts
* headings and structure
* colour
* layout
* writing style

This year's updates cover how word, letter and line spacing contribute to a better reading experience.

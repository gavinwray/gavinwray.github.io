      <p>The second free <a href="http://socialmediasurgery.com/surgeries/central-birmingham">social media surgery</a> for voluntary and community groups in Birmingham was held at the BVSC in Digbeth, 26 November 2008.</p>

<p>The idea behind the surgeries is to help people working in voluntary and community projects in Birmingham to use the web and social media to benefit their work.</p>

<p>Help and support is provided by ‘surgeons’ – bloggers, social media and webby types who provide free advice. They’re a lovely, generous and inspiring bunch with a home on <a href="http://www.paradisecircus.com/">Paradise Circus</a>.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catnipmusic/3061770871/">Photo</a> by <a href="http://www.catnipmusic.co.uk/">Julia Gilbert</a></em></p>

<p>After tentatively toe-dipping into this world at <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/4494/">Brum Bloggers meetups</a>, with friendly encouragement from <a href="http://www.jonbounds.co.uk">Jon Bounds</a>, <a href="http://www.catnipmusic.co.uk/">Julia Gilbert</a> and <a href="http://www.podnosh.com">Nick Booth</a>, I went as a first-time surgeon to see if I could, well, try to pass on some knowledge and learn something new too.</p>

<p>In tandem with fellow first-time surgeon <a href="http://benjaminbrum.wordpress.com/">Ben Whitehouse</a>, we talked with Mark and Michael from the <a href="http://www.birminghamcitysu.com/">Birmingham City University Students’ Union</a>. Mark and Michael were interested in equipping group organisers in the Students’ Union – students working on community projects and fundraising, for example – with the social media tools and skills to run their own online groups.</p>

<p>We talked about free web tools, building and linking between networks. We also discussed the importance of a personal blogging ‘voice’ to help individuals get started with their own blogs on specific community issues, and developing their own networks around these blogs.</p>

<p>I sketched a spider-like diagram of individual blog authors connecting through <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and how the linkages between networks on Twitter can occur. Looking at the sketch now, it’s a mass of scrawled spider death but I hope it proved useful.</p>

<p>We also talked about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>getting your own blog quickly through <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a></li>
  <li>keeping your network informed and building wider connections using Twitter</li>
  <li>starting small by targeting receptive enthusiasts first and encouraging them to blog</li>
  <li>speaking with your own personal voice on your blog</li>
  <li>how <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> can help you monitor your website traffic and understand your visitors’ behaviour, and how it can used to measure the impact of promotions when you attempt to attract more traffic</li>
  <li>aggregating several RSS feeds into one custom feed for your own community using <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo Pipes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Other groups at the social media surgery included:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://brumcitycentre.wordpress.com/">City Centre Neighbourhood Forum</a></li>
  <li>Perry Barr Multifaith Network</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ramblers.org.uk/gwkw/localprojects/birmingham/">Get Walking Keep Walking</a> project</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.digbethtrust.org.uk">Digbeth Trust</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I hope those who came to the surgery received the advice and encouragement they needed to go and try out some of these tools and ideas. I certainly learned about the great work these voluntary groups are doing in Birmingham and the depth of incredible digital talent in this city.</p>

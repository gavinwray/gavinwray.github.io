      <p>It’s been almost a year since I first went to a <a href="http://socialmediasurgery.com/surgeries/central-birmingham">social media surgery for voluntary and community groups</a> in Birmingham. The surgeries are thriving and it’s great to see new surgeries sprouting in <a href="http://bevocal.org.uk/2009/07/08/first-social-media-surgery-for-lozells-tuesday-july-14th-2009/">Lozells</a>, <a href="http://bevocal.org.uk/2009/06/25/social-media-surgery-for-acocks-green-no-1-done/">Acocks Green</a> and Solihull.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasperbs/3637561289/">Photo</a> by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasperbs/">Kasper Sorenson</a></em></p>

<p>One thing I love about these surgeries is that I never know who I’m going to meet or what topics will come up. The randomness is refreshing; it keeps me on my toes. Meeting motivated folk who want to improve their communities is good for the soul.</p>

<p>This social media lark is wide. Those who come to the surgeries for advice may want to talk about anything from how to start a blog, attract more readers to their website or make new contacts using the social web. And that’s just the start.</p>

<p>So, what really happens? What do we talk about?</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of a chat from a surgery in Fazeley Studios on 19 August between Esther Boyd, Paul Hadley and I.</p>

<p>Esther writes about environmental and sustainability issues on her <a href="http://blogs.birminghammail.net/lighterfootprints/">Lighter Footprints blogs</a>. Esther came to the surgery with specific questions (I hope my notes and memory are up to scratch, I’m writing this some time after the event):</p>

<ul>
  <li>how can she use keywords to increase her blog’s ranking in search engines</li>
  <li>how can she get more comments on her posts</li>
  <li>how can she get more people to visit her blog?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="keywords-and-search-engine-rankings">Keywords and search engine rankings</h2>

<p>Spending time worrying about the words to use in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element#The_keywords_attribute">keywords meta tag</a> is not worth it. (There’s typically a keywords box you can fill out when writing a blog. We looked at this on Esther’s blog, which runs on <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html">Google ignores the keywords meta tag</a> in determining the order of its search results. Don’t just take my word for it though:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jK7IPbnmvVU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>While Google ignores the keywords meta tag, this doesn’t mean that all search engines do. <a href="http://m.uk.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> and <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Microsoft’s Bing</a> may do their own thing. With Google being so dominant though, there’s little point in spending much time on the keywords meta tag.</p>

<p>Is there anything to make sure you do to help your blog do well in search engine rankings?</p>

<p>Personally, I regard much of SEO as an unwelcome diversion from the real job of writing good web content that other people might be interested in reading.</p>

<p>Whether you’re new to writing a blog or a veteran of the interwebs, the basics hold true:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write interesting content regularly</li>
  <li>Use appropriate, relevant keywords in the title of your post</li>
  <li>Use sub-headings in the body content</li>
  <li>Link to other people’s sites</li>
</ol>

<p>(I realise I don’t always practice what I preach, particularly writing <em>regularly</em>!)</p>

<h2 id="encourage-more-comments">Encourage more comments</h2>

<p>Esther was pleased that her posts attracted comments, such as this post on <a href="http://blogs.birminghammail.net/lighterfootprints/2009/05/community-recycling-champions.html#comments">community recycling champions</a>. She wanted to increase the number of comments though.</p>

<p>The first thing we mentioned was for Esther to add replies to comments. When someone has taken the time to read the post and add a considered comment, thanking that person shows that you’re listening.</p>

<p>Also, when Esther replies as the author, she has the opportunity to develop the discussion. As well as reacting to the comments, she can lead discussion to new areas.</p>

<p>On the technical side, we discussed ideas to improve the blog’s layout. There’s a list of recent comments on the home page’s sidebar, which demonstrates an active site and a nice community feel:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2009/09/recent-comments.png" alt="Screenshot of recent comments in sidebar of Esther's blog" /></p>

<p>However, the list of recent comments is not shown on any of the other page templates in Esther’s blog (<a href="http://blogs.birminghammail.net/lighterfootprints/2009/09/join-the-global-climate-wake-u.html">post</a>, <a href="http://blogs.birminghammail.net/cgi-bin/mt421/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=444&amp;search=recycling+bins">search results</a> or <a href="http://blogs.birminghammail.net/cgi-bin/mt421/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=444&amp;tag=food&amp;limit=20">archived by category</a>). Not all visitors will land on the blog via the home page. In fact, if the visitor arrives via a web search, it’s more likely that person will land on a single post.</p>

<p>Changing the page layout to show recent comments on every page template is more complex as the blog layout is locked down in a pre-defined template. One for whoever runs the Birmingham Mail blogs.</p>

<h2 id="using-twitter-to-build-a-network">Using Twitter to build a network</h2>

<p>The last part of our chat came about through Esther asking how she could get more people to visit her blog. We talked about social networking, specifically <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, to let other people know when Esther had written a new post or to highlight interesting comments.</p>

<p>While at the surgery, Esther:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/estherboyd">@estherboyd</a></li>
  <li>discovered people in her existing network who are already on Twitter</li>
  <li>updated her profile with a description and a link to her blog</li>
</ul>

<p>Blimey, that feels like a lot after writing it down.</p>

<p>These are some examples of what people talk about at a social media surgery. It could be something completely different <a href="http://socialmediasurgery.com/surgeries/central-birmingham">next time</a>.</p>

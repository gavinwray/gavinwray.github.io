      <p>This is a visual technique you can use to prioritise tasks when faced with competing demands from customers and your employer.</p>

<p>A former manager at the <a href="http://wmro.wordpress.com">West Midlands Regional Observatory</a> showed me this process. I’ve used it a lot since, particularly in my last job with <a href="http://podnosh.com">Podnosh</a>, which involved lots of client-facing work. I imagine the idea comes from the <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_91.htm">Urgent/Important matrix</a> attributed to both the late <a href="https://www.stephencovey.com/">Dr Stephen Covey</a> and former US President Eisenhower.</p>

<h2 id="the-principle">The principle</h2>

<p>Your boss wants you to work on something and your customers have urgent requests. What do you work on first?</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>Think about each task and decide if it’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>urgent for both your customer and employer</li>
  <li>urgent for your employer only</li>
  <li>urgent for your customer only</li>
  <li>not urgent for your employer or customer but needs doing at some point</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, write each task in the relevant quarter of the matrix:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2013/01/work-priority-matrix-540px.png" alt="Work priority matrix shows four segments. X-axis labeled urgent for customer. Y-axis labeled urgent for employer." /></p>

<p>Work on the tasks in quarter one first, then quarter two and so on.</p>

<p>Another way to think about placing tasks is to consider tasks from a risk-averse perspective. While somewhat negative, this can be useful. For example:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>If I don’t this task straight away, this will harm my relationship with the customer. The employer’s business or reputation will suffer.</strong> This is crucial to both employer and customer. Tasks may be related to key dates such as a product launch or milestone agreed in a contract or funding agreement. Tasks may be highly public activity such as a customer’s annual conference.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s important for the health of my employer’s business that I do this task soon.</strong> If I don’t, things will become difficult and I won’t deliver the urgent tasks in quarter 1. This could include writing proposals, generating new work and chasing invoices – lining work up and getting paid for work you’ve delivered. This includes the stuff your boss wants you to do but isn’t a big deal for your customers.</li>
  <li><strong>My customer wants this done now. If I don’t do it soon, they’ll think less of me.</strong> The world won’t end if I don’t jump on this immediately – but if I respond quickly with minimal fuss and solve the customer’s issue, I’ll maintain my relationship with the customer (or even improve it).</li>
  <li><strong>This isn’t urgent to my employer or customer</strong>. I still need to do it though. Typical tasks in this quarter are expense claims, research and learning new skills.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can download the template (A4 landscape) from the following links:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/assets/2013/01/work-priority-matrix-a4-ai.zip">AI (zipped, 299kb)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/assets/2013/01/work-priority-matrix-a4-eps.zip">EPS (zipped, 344kb)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/assets/2013/01/work-priority-matrix-a4.pdf">PDF (63kb)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/assets/2013/01/work-priority-matrix-1200px.png">PNG (5kb)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>What do you think of this approach? Does it work for you? Am I simplifying things too much? Am I being cavalier in bumping customers’ urgent demands to quarter 3?</p>

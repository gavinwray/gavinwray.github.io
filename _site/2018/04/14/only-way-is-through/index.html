      <p>It’s been a heck of a week. One of those where I’ve beaten myself up for not solving particular problems or delivering work I’d committed to doing. I close my eyes and see Chrome’s Developer Tools seared into my eyelids.</p>

<p>The toughest part is not writing the first draft of an article that’s been due for a while. A combination of writer’s block, imposter syndrome and disappearing down a code rabbit hole ended in the inevitable result: no words on the page.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshuafieldsmillburn.com/">Joshua Fields Millburn</a>, author and one half of <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/">The Minimalists</a>, often mentions in the duo’s podcast that “you must be willing to drudge through the drudgery” to achieve personal change or, as in his essay <em><a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/natural/">Not a Natural</a></em>, to hone a skill to a point where it becomes second nature.</p>

<p>Writing, or any learned craft, does not involve waiting for inspiration to strike, then riding a single burst of creative activity to pop out a polished, completed work. It’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>choosing an appropriate approach</li>
  <li>building experience through practice</li>
  <li>being self-aware enough to know when to ask for help</li>
  <li>reducing a problem into manageable chunks</li>
  <li>editing and refining</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s also about turning up and putting in the work.</p>

<p>When I started learning to play the guitar, like most beginners I struggled with the F chord. Whether open or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barre_chord">barred</a>, it was impossible to force down more than one string with my index finger so close to the bottom of the neck, where the string tension is greatest. I could not contort my 11-year-old hand into the necessary shapes.</p>

<p>Gerry, my guitar teacher, transposed AC/DC’s chord progressions so I could play along to their records using a capo and simpler chord shapes that I already knew.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2018/04/capo-min.jpg" alt="Pink capo" /></p>

<p>The sound was not <em>right</em> though and I got frustrated. Granted, a three-quarter scale classical guitar with nylon strings is not the ideal instrument to nail Malcolm Young’s rhythm part on <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_GFN3a0yj0">Thunderstruck</a></em>. The only way to achieve his sound is to barre a B chord. The <a href="http://ultimateclassicrock.com/short-rockers-ac-dc-angus-young-malcolm-young/">5’3” guitarist</a> held it down for a cramp-inducing 44 seconds through the intro and first verse.</p>

<p>I don’t remember the actual moment when I mastered the F or barre chord. I do know that it came through practice, aching fingers and drudgery. Once it became second nature though, a whole new world opened up to me, which made all the effort worthwhile. Hard rock was fair game (and almost the whole of Status Quo’s and Black Sabbath’s back catalogues).</p>

<p>What do I take from all this introspection besides height being no barrier to becoming a titan of hard rock?</p>

<p>For a first draft to exist, <em>the only way is through</em>. No shortcuts. No workarounds. You have to write the darn thing as fast as you can. Dump all the words out of your head on to the page.</p>

<p>Come Monday, I’ll return to my desk and rely on a trusted process. I know I can depend on it. It has served me well for two decades. Sometimes though I forget to stick to the process when the cortisol rages and confidence flees. Lyndsey, my other half and a <a href="https://www.ukbidwriter.com/">bid writer</a> who can conjure coherent applications from the thinnest of material, reminded me of the process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>revisit your notes</li>
  <li>jot down everything you know about the subject</li>
  <li>make an outline with headings and sub-headings to act as a road map for the writing stage</li>
  <li>write a draft of the story you want to write, irrespective of gaps</li>
  <li>highlight the gaps you need to fill</li>
  <li>make a list of those gaps and who you need to talk with to help fill them</li>
</ul>

<p>For my overdue article, I have my notes and a solid outline ready. For a first draft, all that matters <em>is that it exists</em>. No one needs to see it. It’s for me and me alone. A means to an end. One manageable step that leads to another, then another and so on. Persist with those steps and a coherent story will exist.</p>

<p>Now that doesn’t sound so tough.</p>

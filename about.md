Hi, Iâ€™m Gavin, a content designer at [Kainos](https://www.kainos.com/). I help clients to simplify their services with clear language and user-centred design.

I've been working with NHS Digital as a content designer for the [NHS App](https://www.nhs.uk/nhsapp/) since April 2019.

Previously I have:

* led content design and technical writing projects at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/)
* coordinated development of an [impact assessment app](https://www.impactassessmentapp.com/) through alpha and private beta stages, and tested it with pregnancy outreach workers
* run a monthly social media surgery for community groups in Birmingham, the first surgery of its kind in the UK and part of a movement recognised with the Prime Minister's [Big Society Award](https://podnosh.com/blog/2012/02/16/social-media-surgery-movement-wins-the-prime-ministers-big-society-award-hurrah/)
* edited books on design software for [Apress](https://www.apress.com) and [friends of ED](https://openlibrary.org/publishers/friends_of_ED)

Outside all this, I love playing the guitar, recording as [Final Pilots](https://finalpilots.com/), nature and walks with my [dog](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gavinwray/sets/72157642102067755).

Hi, I’m Gavin, a content designer at [Kainos](https://www.kainos.com). I help clients to create and improve digital services through clear language and user-centred design. I provide content expertise, solve user needs in an end-to-end service, and work to NHS and government service standards.

I’m currently working with [NHSX](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk) on a wellness and prevention project.

Previously, I have:

* worked with [Homes England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/homes-england) on affordable home ownership schemes
* worked with NHS Digital to design the [NHS App](https://www.nhs.uk/nhsapp)
* led content design and technical writing projects at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk)

Outside all this, I love playing the guitar, recording as [Final Pilots](https://finalpilots.com), nature, and walks with my dog.

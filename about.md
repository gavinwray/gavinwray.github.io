Hi, Iâ€™m Gavin Wray, a content designer. I help organisations to improve their digital content with clear language and user-centred thinking.

In April 2019 I joined the [Kainos Design team](https://medium.com/kainosxd) as a senior content designer. Currently I'm working on the [NHS App](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app) in a multi-disciplinary team based at NHS Digital in Leeds.

Previously I have:

- led content design and technical writing projects at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/)
- coordinated development of an [impact assessment app](https://www.impactassessmentapp.com/) through alpha and private beta stages, and tested it with pregnancy outreach workers
- run a monthly social media surgery for community groups in Birmingham, the first surgery of its kind in the UK and part of a movement recognised with the Prime Minister's [Big Society Award](https://podnosh.com/blog/2012/02/16/social-media-surgery-movement-wins-the-prime-ministers-big-society-award-hurrah/)
- produced digital communications for the [West Midlands Regional Observatory](https://wmro.wordpress.com/), a social research organisation serving local government
- edited books on design software for [Apress](https://www.apress.com) and [friends of ED](https://openlibrary.org/publishers/friends_of_ED)

Outside all this, I love playing the guitar, recording and remixing as [Final Pilots](https://finalpilots.com/), and walks with my [dog](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gavinwray/sets/72157642102067755).

I've lived in Birmingham (UK) since 2001 but grew up in Stockport. There's still a bit of the northerner about me.

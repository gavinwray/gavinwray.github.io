Hi, Iâ€™m Gavin, a content designer at [Kainos](https://www.kainos.com/). I help clients to simplify their services with clear language and user-centred design.

I'm currently working with [Homes England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/homes-england) on affordable home ownership schemes.

Previously I have:

- worked with NHS Digital to design the [NHS App](https://www.nhs.uk/nhsapp/)
- led content design and technical writing projects at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/)
- coordinated development of an [impact assessment app](https://www.impactassessmentapp.com/) through alpha and private beta stages
- run a monthly social media surgery for community groups in Birmingham, the first of its kind in the UK and part of a movement recognised with a Prime Minister's [Big Society Award](https://podnosh.com/blog/2012/02/16/social-media-surgery-movement-wins-the-prime-ministers-big-society-award-hurrah/)

Outside all this, I love playing the guitar, recording as [Final Pilots](https://finalpilots.com/), nature and walks with my dog.
